\subsection{Goals for the Week}
%Paste output from writeGoals
\begin{enumerate}
	\item PSUADE 1.7.2 on Darter
	\item PSUADE Module that runs as usual
	\item Figure out Command Line arguments for DIEL
	\item Find out what's going on with DAKOTA calling PSUADE
\end{enumerate}



\subsection{Progress/Notes}

\subsubsection{PSUADE 1.7.2 on Darter}


\subsubsection{PSUADE Module that runs as usual}

Building the module comes up with the following error

\verbatiminput{misc/sep29psuademakeerror.txt}

I think it's caused by things (such as INT, FLOAT, DOUBLE, and SUCCESS) being declared elsewhere in PSUADE, then being linked to in MPICXX. \sout{I've tried setting the compiler flags in CMakeCache.txt, but no such luck.}

Solution! cmake -DMPICH\_SKIP\_MPICXX

Also did the cmake library path this way.

ALSO

To fix the grand scheme, use ar command to attach psuademodule function onto libpsuade.so

\subsubsection{Figure out Command Line arguments for DIEL}

\subsubsection{Find out what's going on with DAKOTA calling PSUADE}



\subsection{Goals for next Week}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Fix PSUADE 1.7.2 on Darter
\item Attempt ar addition of main to libpsuade.so
\item if ar fails, find other methods to build the psuade module
\end{enumerate}
